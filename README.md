# Reverse-Shell
In short - controlling a computer from another computer.
In order to run the program, first you must check whether you have python3 installed on your computer or not. If you don't have it, install it.
Second thing, you need to edit the files client.py and server.py (you can via notepad++), and change there the IP address value, to the IP address of the controlling computer.
Third step is to run the "install_libraries.bat" file.
After you completed those steps, you can launch "server.py" on the controlling computer, and the compiled client.exe file on the controlled computer.
